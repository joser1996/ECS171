### Problem 1

Data was divided into four bins by sorting, by mpg, and then dividing by four.
Each bin contains 98 samples each. Cut off indicies were... 

(Rows are 0-indexed)
* Low: 97 (mpg < 17)
* Med: 195 (mpg < 23)
* High: 293 (mpg < 29)
* Very High: 391 (mpg > 30)

### Problem 2

**Scatter Plot Matrix of features**

![Scatter Plot Matrix](https://github.com/joser1996/ECS171/blob/master/ScatterPlotMat.PNG "Scatter Matrix")

In this particular case I would say that the *weight* and *model_year* pair
give me the most information. In this plot I can clearly see each of the
four classes(Low, Med, High, and Very High) clustered together. I can
easily imagine multiple lines being drawn through the plot in order to divide
all four of the classes.
